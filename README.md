# Linear Regression Overview

### Note : This README provides a brief overview of various linear regression techniques along with their equations. Each technique has its advantages and is suitable for different types of data and modeling scenarios.

Linear regression is a widely used statistical technique for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It's a foundational method in machine learning and statistics, with several variants tailored to different scenarios.

## Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression is used when there is a linear relationship between a single independent variable (X) and a dependent variable (Y). The model equation can be represented as:

Y = β0 + β1*X + ε


- **Y**: Dependent variable
- **X**: Independent variable
- **β0**: Intercept
- **β1**: Slope
- **ε**: Error term

## Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression extends simple linear regression to multiple independent variables. The model equation is given by:

Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + ... + βn*Xn + ε


- **X1, X2, ..., Xn**: Independent variables
- **β0**: Intercept
- **β1, β2, ..., βn**: Coefficients of the independent variables
- **ε**: Error term

## Polynomial Regression

Polynomial regression models the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable as an nth degree polynomial. The model equation is given by:

Y = β0 + β1X + β2X^2 + ... + βn*X^n + ε


- **X**: Independent variable
- **X^2, X^3, ..., X^n**: Higher-order terms
- **β0, β1, ..., βn**: Coefficients of the polynomial terms
- **ε**: Error term

## Ridge Regression

Ridge regression is a regularized version of linear regression that introduces a penalty term to the loss function, helping to prevent overfitting. The model equation is similar to multiple linear regression, but with an additional penalty term:

minimize ||Y - Xβ||^2 + λ||β||^2


- **Y**: Dependent variable
- **X**: Independent variables
- **β**: Coefficients
- **λ**: Regularization parameter

## Lasso Regression

Lasso regression is another regularized linear regression technique that introduces a penalty term to the loss function. It tends to produce sparse coefficient vectors, effectively performing variable selection. The model equation is similar to ridge regression but with a different penalty term:

minimize ||Y - Xβ||^2 + λ||β||_1


- **Y**: Dependent variable
- **X**: Independent variables
- **β**: Coefficients
- **λ**: Regularization parameter

## Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

Ordinary least squares is the most basic form of linear regression, aiming to minimize the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values. The model equation is represented as:

minimize Σ(y_i - (β0 + β1*X_i))^2


- **y_i**: Observed values of the dependent variable
- **X_i**: Observed values of the independent variable
- **β0, β1**: Coefficients
